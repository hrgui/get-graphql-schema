# @hrgui/get-graphql-schema

Gets the GraphQL Schema.

# Why was this created?

This is because in GraphQL v15.4+, we can deprecate Input Fields and arguments. However, they are omitted by default.

# WIP

- [x] Test concept
- [ ] Remove hardcoding of variables
- [ ] Make it typescript
- [ ] Make it packagable and publish
- [ ] Read from Config file
